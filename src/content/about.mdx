Hi, I'm Daniel! I'm a freelance full-stack software engineer based in the SF Bay Area.

My [past projects](/projects) include generative-AI products like [the Josh Bersin Company Copilot](/projects/josh-bersin-company) and interactive programming tools like [the Digital Abacus](/projects/digital-abacus).

I build web apps from scratch and work closely with my clients through the design process. I use NextJS, typescript and TailwindCSS for most projects.

If you'd like to work together, send me a DM:
